# Registry Application Touches Visualization

This program takes in a file of Early Childhood Project Registry application submission data. Child Care Licensing rule changed shortly before this analysis was conducted to require Registry participation for all licensed and registered childcare providers in direct care roles, and so we were interested in monitoring the increase of applications and workload on ECP staff. A line graph is created to display number of application touches over time.

The dataset for this project was collected through the Early Childhood Project Registry. This was part of a python data visualization project for Montana State University in Summer 2018, and was used to help inform the Early Childhood Project about workload on ECP staff and to help monitor compliance with the new licensing rule.
